								<p>The idea for this project began to come to me on one cold, winter day. That day my mother brought home cucumbers from a company called «Sayuri», and naturally I wondered what they were, since we don't usually buy vegetables in the winter. When I asked why she bought them, the answer was that she had read about the new garden in Yakutsk in the news and decided to try their products. What a surprise it was to me when the cucumbers, grown in the middle of winter, were the freshest and tastiest cucumbers I have eaten in my entire life. 
After that, I started buying these cucumbers from only one, specific store. After a while, I started to see these cucumbers in other stores and in spring, when a friend of mine from a village came to Yakutsk, he said he really enjoyed the cucumbers here without me even mentioning them. Vegetables from this greenhouse complex spread throughout the city in the shortest period of time.
After a bit of research, I learned that «Sayuri» is an investment project between Yakutsk and Japan. Japanese equipment was used, as well as design solutions of a team of Japanese and Russian engineers.</p>

								<p>The «Sayuri» greenhouse complex grows more than just cucumbers. According to the Press Service of the Head of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia): "Today, the automated greenhouse complex with an area of 3.3 hectares consists of 16 greenhouses. The assortment includes Meva cucumbers, 4 varieties of tomatoes, various types of leaf lettuce, greens. Radish is grown in the spring period. In small batches sold peppers, eggplants. Variety trials of strawberries and strawberries (Fragaria) with the further intention to modernize the greenhouse for the production of berries.” A couple of years ago, I couldn't have imagined that Yakutsk would grow all kinds of greens all year round. What was unheard of is now becoming a reality.
                                    According to the same source, "Vegetables are very popular with the local population. 18-20% of the total volume is supplied to kindergartens - 60 city kindergartens are supplied with fresh vegetables. When reaching its design capacity of 2700 tons in 2023, the greenhouse complex will be able to provide up to 25% of the population of the city of Yakutsk.”
                                    </p>
                                <p>Looking at all these amazing results, I thought that this kind of practice is the most common, it's just that I did not know about it. However, I only found on the Internet a single similar greenhouse complex - «GreenHouse Ventures» located in the Republic of Cameroon. 
                                    Both companies are solving the problem of food scarcity in regions with extreme climates, but neither has received worldwide attention, which I think is a huge mistake. I want to spread the word about the effectiveness of greenhouse complexes and to be honest, I have always had a sense of owing to my homeland, so I want Yakutia not to go down in history only as the coldest republic, I want Yakutia to become a region that has overcome its problem.
                                    There are many other regions that have problems with agriculture, such as Mongolia, Africa, Greenland, etc. Citizens of these places are forced to overpay for imported fruits and vegetables, in other words they pay more for less fresh. In some regions, residents can’t even afford said food.
